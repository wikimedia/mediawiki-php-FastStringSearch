This feature has been deprecated and should not be used with current versions of MediaWiki. This
feature was deprecated and removed completely in version 1.27.

FastStringSearch was obsoleted by PHP 5.5, and MediaWiki hasn't used it since pre-1.27.
Additionally, it's problematic to distribute binaries of it because of licensing issues.
